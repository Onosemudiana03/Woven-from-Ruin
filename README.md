# Woven-from-Ruin
The Phoenix Bird and the Light of Rebirth
As a teenager a little while ago, all I wanted to do was to explore, be freee, have fun
This fun was distant from the fun I ws taught, a thousnd times below the fun i should have been having
Let's call it the good and bad fun
Yes, I knew the wrongs i was doing yet i kept on with them,
I hated myself, lied every morning to myself that I was okay
I was in too much that i didn't think i would ever come out
When in so bad, that's probably all you can believe in
You are gone and there's really noting you can do 
I hit what i would call rock bottom and that's when everthing around me came crumbling
I was still gone but back with a little knowing that this wasn't it, it wasn't what i really wanted
This knowing made me hate myself more, instead of taking me coser to redemption, i found myself crawling away
I crawled because i knew i had to be redeeemed but i didn't think i could get it, so even with my said knowing, i still passed as hopeless
I changed environment, felt better and saw a glimpse of light around for the first time in a while
Was it the change of scenery, happy to be way from my constant reminder or was i just all done with punishing myself? I don't know 
That glimpse I saw, it took a long time to turn it into a lamp
I stayed on that ray, i stumbled on it, was angry because the light was a flash at times
But yet, every time I got angry, i was reminded by a voice in my head that everything right from the moment of glimpse, to rays and flashes were all a process
So i waited on the flash, overtime, it turned to a stable light,
It went low at times, sometimes shined so bright but i made sure to not let it go out
And like that, i was woven from the ruin I created myself gradually, 
My story reminds me of the phoenix bird, who yet dead is believed to be reborn from its own ashes
Becoming alive again to see the light of its rebirth
